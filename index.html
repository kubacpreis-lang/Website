    <p>
      I am an R&amp;D engineer currently working in a metal additive manufacturing startup called
      <a href="https://www.valcun.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ValCUN</a> in Belgium.
      My main research interest revolves around increasing the technology readiness level of
      <strong>metal additive manufacturing</strong> by understanding the physical fundamentals behind the process.
      I also really geek out on engineering / physics derivations and I am passionate about engineering education. Before joining <a href="https://www.valcun.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ValCUN</a>, 
      I worked at <a href="https://www.divergent3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divergent Technologies</a> as an additive manufacturing engineer, and did my PhD at <a href="https://atami.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon State University</a>.
    </p>



    <p>
      On this website you will find some <a href="research.html">research and projects</a> I have worked on or am working on, and a <a href="cv.html">CV</a>.
      I have also spent the past 7 years writing a <a href="book.html">book</a> on engineering derivations.
      This book takes a pyramid approach by presenting axioms in the mathematics, applied statistics,
      physics, and chemistry chapters, and using these to derive fundamental equations within classical mechanics,
      materials engineering, solid mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electrical engineering.
      Some excerpts from this book can be found in the <a href="book.html">book</a> tab on the left hand side of this page.
      However, please note this <a href="book.html">book</a> is a work in progress.

      Outside of work I enjoy being outdoors (hiking, biking) and learning languages.
