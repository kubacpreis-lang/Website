<p>The purpose of an engineering education is predict outputs given inputs within the physical world. By doing this,
experiments do not need to be conducted to predict a certain behavior; instead, an equation can be used. This saves time and
money. The models/equations used to predict behavior within the physical world can be boiled down to two classifications.
These are <em><span class='cmti-10'>empirical</span></em> models and <em><span class='cmti-10'>analytical</span></em> models. Empirical models are based off of the observation of patterns. Essentially,
we are fitting an equation to a dataset. Analytical models are mathematical manipulations based off of physical axioms. The
process of combining mathematical manipulations to physical axioms in the goal of obtaining a analytical equation is called
<em><span class='cmti-10'>deriving</span></em>. <br class='newline' />
</p> 
<p>The objective of this book is to provide a coherent overview of how the physical world is modeled, specifically geared at
engineering applications. In order to accomplish this, fundamental physical concepts are introduced. Derivations for the most
important analytical equations in engineering are presented. <br class='newline' />
</p> 
<p>Many books already exist which include the information summarized herein. However, two factors differentiate this book
from the prevailing literature. The first is, as already mentioned, this book is comprehensive. Physics and engineering are
intimately connected, and many derivations used within engineering derive from physics derivations/axioms. In addition,
many engineering topics themselves are closely connected. Current textbooks and courses themselves are segmented. For
example, dynamics (chapter <span class='cmbx-10'>??</span>) and solid mechanics (chapter <span class='cmbx-10'>??</span>) are grouped and taught separately from each other and
from fluid mechanics (chapter <span class='cmbx-10'>??</span>). However, fluids are modeled by using the same physical axioms as dynamics (chapter <span class='cmbx-10'>??</span>)
combined with differential approaches (differential equations are overviewed in chapter <a href='mainch2.html#mathematics-fundamentals'>2<!-- tex4ht:ref: chapter_math  --></a>) used in solid mechanics (chapter
<span class='cmbx-10'>??</span>). By combining engineering, math, and physics topics into a single book, connections can be made which would be
otherwise be left out. The second differentiate of this book is the target tone. As you may have experience with,
engineering textbooks are often extremely boring. In fact, I have personally used textbooks to help myself fall
asleep before when having insomnia. In this book, a more conversational tone is adopted in the hope of a more
pleasurable reading experience. In addition, information is provided concisely; the minimum information is
provided so that the reader can fully understand the concept/derivation. Some books that have served as an
inspiration for me when writing this book are <em><span class='cmti-10'>Transmission Electron Microscopy</span></em> by Williams and Carter,
<em><span class='cmti-10'>Welding Metallurgy</span></em> by Kou and <em><span class='cmti-10'>Phase Transformations in Metals and Alloys</span></em> by Porter, Easterling, and Sherif.

<p>While this book is written to be comprehensive, the material presented herein assumes the reader posses a high school level
physics and math understanding. The mathematics in this book begins at a calculus level. Although basic physics and
chemistry concepts are reviewed, the reader is expected to be familiar with basic physical phenomena such as waves.
