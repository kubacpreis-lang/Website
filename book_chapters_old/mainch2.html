<p>The objective of this chapter is to give provide the reader with a fundamental understanding of undergraduate level
mathematics concepts. Only the most important mathematics concepts necessary for later physical derivations are
overviewed. Mathematical concepts can be at times abstract, therefore, this is the only chapter in which each section will
include a brief worked example with the hope this will allow the reader to gain a more in-depth understanding.

<p>When studying mathematics, it is important to remember the rigorous system that mathematicians have set up to
define mathematics. Mathematics is a field which is defined by precise mathematical definitions and proofs for
every operation; starting with concepts as basic as the definition of integers. This book will not focus on such
definitions and proofs; again, only what is necessary for later derivations is presented here. However, it would
be remiss to not mention this invisible structure that props up the subject that is used daily by engineers.
